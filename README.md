# 🎮 Gemini CLI Game Development

### AI-Assisted Game Built Using Google Gemini CLI

🚀 This project demonstrates game development using only the Command Line Interface (CLI) powered by Google Gemini, without relying on traditional IDE-driven workflows.
The game was conceptualized, structured, and developed through AI-assisted prompt engineering and terminal-based development.

---

## 🧠 Project Concept

This repository showcases an experimental approach to software and game development where an AI model (Google Gemini) is used via CLI to generate, refine, and build a functional browser-based game.

Instead of conventional coding workflows, the entire development pipeline focused on:

* AI-driven code generation
* CLI-based development process
* Iterative prompt engineering
* Rapid prototyping using LLM assistance

This makes the project a unique blend of AI, game development, and developer tooling innovation.
