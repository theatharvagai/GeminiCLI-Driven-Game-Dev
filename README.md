# 🚀 Project Overview

**Gemini CLI Game Development** is an experimental AI-first game development project where the entire game was conceptualized, structured, and built using only the Google Gemini CLI — without relying on traditional IDE-based workflows.

Instead of manually coding everything from scratch, this project explores how **LLMs + CLI + Prompt Engineering** can accelerate real-world software development.

---

# 🧠 Core Concept

This repository demonstrates a modern development paradigm where:

* AI acts as a coding assistant via CLI
* Development happens through prompt-driven iterations
* Rapid prototyping replaces traditional development cycles

The project blends:

> 🎮 Game Development + 🤖 Generative AI + 💻 CLI Engineering
